# yolor-edge

An implementation of [YOLOR](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolor) running successfully on the [NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-xavier-nx-devkit).

## YOLOR

[You Only Learn One Representation: Unified Network for Multiple Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04206) (YOLOR) is a novel, state-of-the-art object detection algorithm producing world-leading performance results, published in May 2021.

All credit goes to:
- Chien-Yao Wang, I-Hau Yeh and Hong-Yuan Mark Liao for their groundbreaking paper, [You Only Learn One Representation: Unified Network for Multiple Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04206).
- Kin-Yiu, Wong for his original implementation of YOLOR in PyTorch, on which this work is built: [YOLOR](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolor)

## Thesis

This code forms part of a B.Eng(Hons) (Instrumentation and Control / Industrial Computer Systems) thesis, with the aim of evaluating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence research for application in urban search and rescue. As successful implementation and testing of YOLOR on edge devices (embedded systems) was previously unavailable in literature, the overarching aim was assessing suitability for real-world field use in autonomous mobile robotics.

Releases at specific points are available below.

## Further Details

The thesis this repository is attached to is slated for publication in February 2022. Further details, including more specifics around implementation and use, will be made available as soon as practical.

## Commit History

Unfortunately, a fair bit of burning the midnight oil and running purely on caffeine lead to some kafuffles around commit history in this repo, namely due to tired eyes mishmashing Git submodules.
